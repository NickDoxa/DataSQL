     <p>This app was designed to simplify and expedite the process of sending/receiving
     data to/from an SQL Database. It is not an advanced software, it is a project I developed
     to test my own knowledge of Java and SQL. If you think it sucks, feel free to never let
     it run on your computer. If you want to use it, have at it. If you are a hiring manager
     looking at my portfolio, this project includes:</p>
